## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd MlProject
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Place your raw data in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run Preprocessing:**  
   Execute preprocessing scripts in `src/`.

3. **Model Training:**  
   Train models using scripts or notebooks provided.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   Evaluate model performance using test scripts.

5. **Deployment:**  
   Deploy the trained model using the deployment scripts or APIs.
